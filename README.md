# Video Game Sales 1980-2020

The main goal of this project was to explore database of video game sales in SQL via queries to find interesting results.  Final query forms table that is used to create Tableau dashboard where video game sales are vizualized at the turn of the millenium.

Notes throughout queries on SQL file mention findings of each query, flaws in data noticed, and my train of thought during exploration.

All database queries are my own.

PROJECT STEPS:

  Import database to postgresql
  
  Inspect and query
  
  Export final query as excel file
  
  Clean excel file (identify null values if any), replace values for better understanding, etc.
  
  Import excel file into Tableau and create interactive dashboard

Database formation was assisted by: https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_videogames/postgres -- data was gathered from free online source.

*"Sales" figures are all indicative of number of copies sold, not dollar amounts
